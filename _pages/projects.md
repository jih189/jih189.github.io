HOME ROBOT PROJECT(Current)
======
Intelligent home robots: An intelligent home robot is exemplified by a robot that can “reset” your home or put away the groceries or go fetch the coffee from the kitchen. The robot is required to operate in a semi-structured setting, understand the semantic organization of the home and manipulate objects to solve its tasks. A key part of the project is natural interaction with human users and other agents in the environment.

I am responsible for the task planning part, which includes the task decomposition, task sequencing, and task scheduling. I am also responsible for the motion planning part, which includes the motion planning for the robot arm and the mobile base.

ASSEMBLY PROJECT(2018-2019)
======
The Assembly project entails designing an end-to-end pipeline for assembling products from individual parts using two UR5 robotic arms. This pipeline encompasses three primary stages: perception, planning, and execution.

In this endeavor, my responsibilities span several crucial areas:

<b>System Integration</b>: I configured the URDF file for the complete system and seamlessly incorporated the gripper into the planning scene.

<b>Perception</b>: I pioneered our proprietary deep learning method to accurately estimate the 6D pose of objects.

<b>Planning</b>: I crafted a constraint-based planning approach to methodically generate the assembly sequence.

<b>Control</b>: I employed impedance control, ensuring the robotic arms assemble the parts with precision.
