As a beginner in reinforcement learning (RL), I'm eager to dive into this field. IsaacLab has demonstrated its effectiveness through numerous showcases and is designed to facilitate the rapid development of RL-based robotics projects. However, the tutorial can be challenging for first-time users, so I had to delve into the source code to gain a better understanding. I've compiled my notes on working with RL projects in IsaacLab and am sharing them in the hope that they will be helpful to others.
