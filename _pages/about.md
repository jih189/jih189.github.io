I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego. I have the privilege of conducting my research in the [Cognitive Robotics Lab](https://www.cogrob.org/), under the esteemed guidance of [Prof. Henrik I. Christensen](https://www.hichristensen.com/). My primary research revolves around task and motion planning for mobile robots, with a particular emphasis on home service robots. Additionally, I possess a keen interest in exploring perception for manipulation.
